### Variable Declaration:

In Kotlin, variable can be declared using `val` or `var` keywords.

`val` is immutable and `var` is mutable.

### Checking Equality:

In java `==` used to compare referential equality of the object and `.equals()` used to compare structural equality of
the object. But, in Kotlin `==` is used to compare referential as well as structural equality of the object.

To check referential equality in Kotlin, you need to use `===` (triple equals).
